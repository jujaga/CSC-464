CSC 464 Project
Jeremy Ho & Stephen Tredger

This project explores the dnaml algorithm from the PHYLIP package and attempts to implement concurrency into key sections of the algorithm to get a performance increase.

The original one is in phylip-3.69. CUDA, OpenMP and OpenCL will be looked into for concurrency.
